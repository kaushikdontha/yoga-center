    <p className="mb-4">
      Ravi Yoga Center was born from a simple, yet powerful idea by Ravi himself: to create a welcoming sanctuary where everyone, regardless of experience or background, feels empowered to explore the transformative practice of yoga. As the sole founder and instructor, Ravi believes that yoga is for every body. His personal journey with yoga transformed his own life, igniting a vision to share its incredible benefits – from physical vitality to mental clarity and emotional well-being – with our local community.
